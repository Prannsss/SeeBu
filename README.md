# SEEBU

**A Unified Complaints and Public Services Hub for Cebu City**

---

## Overview

**SEEBU** is a Progressive Web Application (PWA) designed to streamline communication between Cebu City residents and local government units (LGUs). It allows users to report community issues, request services, and track resolutions in real time — all in one centralized platform.
